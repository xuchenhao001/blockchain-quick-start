# The client section is SDK-specific. The sample below is for the node.js SDK

client:
  # Which organization does this application instance belong to? The value must be the name of an org
  # defined under "organizations"
  organization: Org1

  # Some SDKs support pluggable KV stores, the properties under "credentialStore"
  # are implementation specific
  credentialStore:
    # [Optional]. Specific to FileKeyValueStore.js or similar implementations in other SDKs. Can be others
    # if using an alternative impl. For instance, CouchDBKeyValueStore.js would require an object
    # here for properties like url, db name, etc.

    # [Optional]. Specific to the CryptoSuite implementation. Software-based implementations like
    # CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js in node SDK requires a key store. PKCS#11 based implementations does
    # not.
    cryptoStore:
      # Specific to the underlying KeyValueStore that backs the crypto key store.
